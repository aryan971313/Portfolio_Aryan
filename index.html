                    Hi! My name is Aryan and I'm a geospatial enthusiast driven by the power of GIS to uncover critical insights.
                    Currently completing a GIS Co-op with Bruce County and on track to graduate from Fanshawe College in August 2025, I've gained hands-on experience in field data collection, spatial analysis with ArcPy, remote sensing, and cartographic design.
                    My background in Fanshawe's Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems course and a Bachelor's in Aeronautical Engineering from Manipal gives me advanced RPAS pilot skills and aerial-imagery expertise.
                    As an Emerging GIS Professional (GISP-E) and 2025 Nathan Adams Student Bursary winner, I'm committed to integrating geospatial and drone technologies to deliver actionable solutions.
