            <h2> My Portfolio</h2>
            <p>
                Below are a few projects that I have worked on throught my learning journey.
               
            </p>
            <ul>
                <p>
                    <li><strong>Project 1:</strong><em><strong> Landscape Ecology - Forest Regeneration | QGIS </strong></em> 
                        &mdash; 
                        <a href="Docs/ForestAnalysis.pdf" target="_blank">View Forest Analysis Map (PDF)</a>
                        <br> 
                        •	Analyzed ~9,000 hectares of woodlot data in QGIS and identified 3,350 hectares (High Priority) 
                        & 11,315 hectares (Medium Priority) for restoration. 
                        • Utilized buffer, difference, circle (centroid) analyses, and road proximity exclusion to map optimal regeneration zones. 
                        • Produced a final cartographic layout and workflow infographic summarizing total reforestation areas. </li>
                    </p>
                <p>
                <li><strong>Project 2:</strong><em><strong> Flood Risk Awareness StoryMap | ArcGIS Online, Survey123, Esri StoryMaps</strong> </em> • Designed an interactive StoryMap that explores London, Ontario, through the Thames River, highlighting its history, ecological role, and vulnerability to flooding.
                    • Visualized community survey results, revealing critical gaps in flood awareness—66.67% unaware of floodplain status, 95.24% lacking emergency flood plans—and proposed strategies to enhance preparedness.
                    • Proposed 4+ actionable solutions, including flood awareness programs, green infrastructure, and improved stormwater drainage, fostering community resilience.
                    • Presented the StoryMap, combining visual storytelling with GIS insights to effectively communicate flood risk mitigation strategies. </li>

                </p>
                <p>
                <li><strong>Project 3:</strong><em><strong> Thermal Roof Inspection | FLIR Tools</strong> </em> Leveraged infrared technology to identify roofing flaws not immediately visible to the naked eye. Utilized the DJI Matrice 300 RTK drone with Zenmuse XT payload for precise thermal scanning.
                    • Employed FLIR Tools software to analyze thermal images, successfully detecting 4 anomalies on the roof of the building.</li>
                </p>  
                <li><strong>Project 4:</strong><em><strong> Drone Survey and Topography Mapping Project | Pix4D, QGIS</strong> </em> Conducted a comprehensive survey and mapping project using drone imagery, capturing high-resolution 2D images of the college field. Utilized Pix4D to convert 2D drone images into detailed 3D models, ensuring accuracy by matching control points.
                    • Generated Digital Terrain Models (DTM) and Digital Surface Models (DSM) from processed data. Employed QGIS to create contour lines from DTM and DSM data, facilitating detailed topographic analysis.
                    • Ensured precise geospatial data collection and analysis through the integration of control points and advanced photogrammetry techniques.</li>
